## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive example of how to build and deploy a REST API with Django. The API supports typical operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources (CRUD), and includes essential RESTful principles such as authentication, serialization, and URL routing.

## Features
- Full CRUD functionality for data models
- User authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Serialization of data using Django REST Framework's serializers
- Token-based authentication
- URL routing and viewsets for API endpoints
- Well-structured project organization following Django's best practices

## Technologies
- **Django**: High-level Python web framework for rapid development.
- **Django REST Framework**: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- **SQLite3** (default Django database): Lightweight database used for development.
- **djangorestframework-simplejwt**: For JSON Web Token-based authentication.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
   cd yourprojectname
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate    # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

You can log in as the superuser to manage resources or create new users via the Django admin panel at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

## API Endpoints

Some example endpoints include:

| Method | Endpoint              | Description           |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| GET    | `/api/items/`          | Retrieve all items    |
| POST   | `/api/items/`          | Create a new item     |
| GET    | `/api/items/{id}/`     | Retrieve a specific item by ID |
| PUT    | `/api/items/{id}/`     | Update a specific item by ID   |
| DELETE | `/api/items/{id}/`     | Delete a specific item by ID   |

Note: Add your specific endpoints and details once the project is complete.
